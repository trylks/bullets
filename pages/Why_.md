title:: Why?

- What stays in your head may as well not exist. Better sharing a draft than nothing at all.
- Too many drafts in progress, too many ideas to connect. Small added value in further explanation.
	- When some further explanation is useful: [sigmoid](https://sigmoid.substack.com).
- Twitter is not too bad as a zettelkasten, but the shortcomings are becoming more and more apparent over time. Logseq and similar solutions (foam research) allow easy backups.
	- Local
	- Online git repositories to render the result.
		- Testing GitHub actions.
		- Pending: GitLab.
- So far, this is only a test that I am exploring. Logseq has pros and cons wrt other options.
  * I like foam, but the possibility of making slides from logseq may be a killer feature.
  * It needs making the nodes bigger. Not a problem, just a "gotcha".
  * Nice to have in any case.

- # Slides
  * This is good, seriously.
  * It is terrible, but it is good.
  * I mean, if I am forced to prepare slides...
