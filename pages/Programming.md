- Two step process
	- Study and develop your taste
	  * [Paul Graham: Taste](http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html)
	  * [Martin Fowler: Code Smells](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html)
	  * [Jeff Atwood: Code Smells](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-smells/)
		- Read books, e.g. functional programming books (I like functional programming)
		  * [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs)
		  * [Clojure for the brave and true](https://www.braveclojure.com/)
		  * [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
		- Watch talks (I like LEAN)
		  * Anything from Sandi Metz, e.g. [Poly want a message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXi_FBrZQiU)
		  * #TODO
		- Other talks that may or may not help to develop a taste but are still interesting
		  * [Bret Victor: The Future of Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4)
		  * [Thomas Figg: Programming is terribleâ€”Lessons learned from a life wasted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csyL9EC0S0c)
	- Practice
	  * [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)
	  * [HakerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
	  * [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
	  * [EggHead](https://egghead.io/)
	  * Or just your day job, so you get paid for practicing
