	- Tags, in particular aliases
	- Hiccup: very powerful, especially when combined with custom css, e.g. it may make the OG unnecessary, i.e. make a card manually with:
	  * Title
	  * URL
	  * Summary (here you can choose what to highlight, while automated cards do not allow this)
	  * Image
	  Additional JS may make the process less manual and annoying, e.g. fully automated cards, with _optional_ summaries
